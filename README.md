## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or newer.
* .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later (usually pre-installed or prompted if missing).

### Installation

The easiest way to get TrayTemps running is to download the latest release:

1.  Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/YourUsername/TrayTemps/releases).
2.  Download the `TrayTemps.zip` file from the latest release.
3.  Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\Program Files\TrayTemps`).
4.  Run `TrayTemps.exe`.

**For Autostart (Recommended):**
Once the application is running, go to the **Settings** tab within the TrayTemps window and check the "**Autostart with Windows**" option. This will install TrayTemps to a standard program location (`C:\Program Files\TrayTemps`), set it to launch silently on logon, and create a desktop shortcut for convenience. The app will restart automatically after this process.

### Uninstallation

To completely remove TrayTemps from your system:

1.  Open the TrayTemps application.
2.  Go to the **Settings** tab.
3.  Uncheck the "**Autostart with Windows**" option.
4.  You will be prompted with removal options:
    * **Yes:** Removes all installed files, shortcuts, and startup entries.
    * **No:** Only removes the startup entry, leaving the installed files.
    * **Cancel:** Does nothing.
    Choose **Yes** for a complete cleanup.
